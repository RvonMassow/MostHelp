chapter:Validation[Validation]

section:ValidationIntroduction[Introduction]

Validation is an essential part of a modeling language. With the help of e[constraints]
it ensures that certain scenarios can not happen in order to avoid problems
based on invalid states of model elements.

With the help of validation in ModuleStudio all subsequent components can process
the given application model without having to revalidate common concerns.

Having clean and properly validated models is also very helpful for Zikula as a framework because in
the long term this leads to a constantly high quality across third party extensions which is traditionally
a weak point for every open source system. See link[http://modulestudio.de/en/tutorial/validation-instead-of-certification-of-3rd-party-framework-modules.html][this
tutorial] for more information about this aspect.

The constraints described here are evaluated within the graphical editor as well as
during headless generator workflows.

section:ValidationBasicUsage[Basic usage]

This section gives a brief overview of how validation can be executed and what can
be done if problems occur.

section2:ValidationTrigger[Triggering validation]

In common use cases it is not required to do anything manually. ModuleStudio does
automatically perform a e[live validation] so you get immediate feedback after having
done some model amendments.

For more complex model this can be come inconvenient with regards to performance as
the live validation has to check many rules every few seconds. In these cases one
can simply deactivate the live validation by stopping the according jobs in the
process view (see link[http://modulestudio.de/en/tutorial/controlling-validation-manually.html][this
tutorial]).

section2:ValidationConsequences[Validation consequences]

As the generator requires a model without validation problems it can only be started in the main menu
after your model has no errors left.

If the menu entry for starting the generator is inactive even if your models seems to be clean, please
save the model in the main editor and click once in the diagram canvas to let the validation update it's
state accordingly.

In case live validation has been deactivated you can start a e[manual validation] in
the main menu, too.

section:ValidationReference[Reference]

This section lists all validation rules in detail and explains the motivation behind them. You can use
this reference to search for certain error messages if you want to know more about the background. If
you are unsure about the terminology used in a description please refer to the ref:Generator[generator chapter]
in this documentation.
